# Send data over ICMP
Useless (or not ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) class for sending and reciving data over ICMP.
sender.py – class for sending data over ICMP packets (with implemented automatic data segmentation and compression) in *data* field.
reciver.py – class for reciving data sent over ICMP packets (with desegmentation and decompression).
It should work!
